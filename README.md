ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @LudoNiri

I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, native Javascript, angular.Js, Git and Github to be a developer.

I'm a French graphic designer and use the Adobe package (Photoshop, Illustrator, XD, Dreamviewer, Indesign) and Figma.

But I also like to develop websites with code. All the elements here are created by me (logo and website) and I'm very much looking forward to working and offering my services.
